                        <p>Cobolt’s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an isolated network designed especially for your cloud resources. It gives you complete authority to determine how your resources communicate while also ensuring inbound and outbound filtering of traffic on your instances. You can create multiple VPCs swiftly using our intuitive customer portal, CLIs and APIs. If your network setup is one of the common ones, you just need to select the best suited one and the VPC will automatically configure all the network settings such as IP ranges, route tables and security groups. </p>
