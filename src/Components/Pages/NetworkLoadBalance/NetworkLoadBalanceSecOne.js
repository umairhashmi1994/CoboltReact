                        <h3>Ensuring Secure and Scalable Infrastructure </h3>
                        <p>Cobolt load balancers ensures influx of secure traffic only by providing SSL configuration options. Along with SSL certificates, HTTP/2 is also supported, providing better performance. By using load balancers, you can also add and remove instances from your infrastructure, and the load balancer itself will conduct intelligent routing of incoming traffic. All kinds of workload can be distributed, from a blog, an ecommerce site to a large application cluster.  All load balancers include built-in health monitoring, temporarily removing unhealthy atoms out of the loop till they are fixed.</p>
