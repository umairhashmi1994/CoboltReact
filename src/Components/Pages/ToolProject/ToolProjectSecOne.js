                        <p>Projects act as a world-class organizational tool especially developed to make it easier for a user to navigate and allocate their resources. Users can create projects that align with the applications and environments. Using projects, you can match resources like atoms, spaces and load balancers to a purpose youâ€™re using it for. Similarly, these resources can also be separated in case of different clients or development and production requirements. </p>
